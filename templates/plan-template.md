# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, architecture.md, data-design.md, deployment.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: [#] (max 3 - e.g., api, cli, tests)
- Using framework directly? (no wrapper classes)
- Single data model? (no DTOs unless serialization differs)
- Avoiding patterns? (no Repository/UoW without proven need)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (no direct app code)
- Libraries listed: [name + purpose for each]
- CLI per library: [commands with --help/--version/--format]
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned?

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (test MUST fail first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation?
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed?
- Real dependencies used? (actual DBs, not mocks)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas?
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included?
- Frontend logs → backend? (unified stream)
- Error context sufficient?

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- BUILD increments on every change?
- Breaking changes handled? (parallel tests, migration plan)

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each technology choice → best practices and integration patterns
   - For database selection → performance, scaling, and migration considerations
   - For service architecture → communication patterns and deployment strategies

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   For service architecture decisions:
     Task: "Research service communication patterns for {use case}"
   For database decisions:
     Task: "Evaluate {database} for {data patterns} and {scale requirements}"
   For interface design:
     Task: "Research design patterns for {specific domain/problem}"
   ```

3. **Service Architecture Research**:
   - Identify service boundaries based on business capabilities
   - Research microservice vs monolith trade-offs for this project
   - Evaluate service communication patterns (sync vs async)
   - Research deployment and orchestration requirements

4. **Database & Storage Research**:
   - Evaluate database options against data patterns and scale
   - Research schema migration strategies for chosen database
   - Investigate caching and performance optimization patterns
   - Plan backup, recovery, and monitoring approaches

5. **Class Design & Patterns Research**:
   - Research applicable design patterns for identified problems
   - Evaluate inheritance vs composition trade-offs
   - Plan dependency injection and testing strategies
   - Research error handling and exception design patterns

6. **State Management & Lifecycle Research**:
   - Identify entities requiring state machines from functional requirements
   - Research state machine patterns for identified entities
   - Evaluate object lifecycle management strategies
   - Investigate concurrency control and locking mechanisms
   - Research event-driven architecture patterns if applicable
   - Plan temporal state management (timeouts, scheduling, expiration)

7. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]
   - Implementation considerations: [key technical details]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved and technical foundation established

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **MANDATORY: System Architecture** → `architecture.md` (EXACT FILENAME):
   - **Service Design**: Core services, boundaries, communication patterns
   - **Project Structure**: Directory organization, module separation
   - **Integration Patterns**: How services/components connect
   - **Technology Integration**: Framework usage, dependency patterns

2. **MANDATORY: Data & State Design** → `data-design.md` (EXACT FILENAME):
   - **Database Schema**: Tables, indexes, constraints, relationships
   - **Entity Modeling**: Core domain objects and their properties
   - **State Machines**: Which entities have state, valid transitions, business rules
   - **Object Lifecycle**: Creation, initialization, state changes, cleanup, destruction
   - **Concurrency & Locking**: Version control, optimistic/pessimistic locking
   - **Event Patterns**: State change events, domain events, event sourcing
   - **Temporal Concerns**: Time-based state changes, expiration, scheduling
   - **Class Design**: Interfaces, inheritance, composition for data/state management
   - **Persistence Patterns**: How objects are saved, loaded, cached

3. **MANDATORY: Deployment & Operations** → `deployment.md` (EXACT FILENAME):
   - **Default Strategy**: Simple local development setup
     * Local database (SQLite, local PostgreSQL, etc.)
     * Direct application execution (no containers by default)
     * File-based configuration
     * Development-friendly defaults
   - **Conditional Sections** (only if explicitly mentioned in requirements):
     * **Security & Privacy** (if security/privacy requirements specified):
       - Authentication and authorization strategies
       - Data encryption and protection
       - Privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
       - Security headers and protections
       - Audit logging and monitoring
     * **Performance & Scaling** (if performance requirements specified):
       - Load balancing and scaling strategies
       - Caching layers and optimization
       - Database performance tuning
       - Monitoring and alerting
       - Performance testing approaches
     * **Production Deployment** (if production requirements specified):
       - Container/cloud deployment strategies
       - Infrastructure as code
       - CI/CD pipeline design
       - Environment management
       - Backup and disaster recovery

4. **API Contracts Design** → `/contracts/`:
   - For each user action → endpoint specification
   - Define request/response schemas with validation rules
   - **State-Related APIs**:
     * Design state query endpoints (current state, history)
     * Define state transition endpoints with validation
     * Plan bulk state operation APIs if needed
     * Design state event subscription APIs
   - Plan API versioning strategy and backward compatibility
   - Design authentication and authorization per endpoint
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema files

5. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint/service interface
   - Assert request/response schemas and business rules
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)
   - Include database integration test scaffolding

6. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps
   - Include service interaction tests

7. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**REQUIRED Output**:
- architecture.md (NOT services-architecture.md)
- data-design.md (NOT data-model.md)
- deployment.md (NEW FILE)
- /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST create these exact filenames. Do not use old naming like data-model.md or system-design.md.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate milestone-based tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- Group tasks by logical feature boundaries (milestones)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Milestone Strategy**:
- **Small features** (1-5 endpoints): Single milestone
- **Medium features** (6-15 endpoints): 2-3 milestones by feature groups
- **Large features** (16+ endpoints): 3-4 milestones by user workflows
- Each milestone delivers working, testable functionality

**Branch Strategy**:
- **Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` - main development branch
- **Milestone Branches**: `[###-feature-name]/milestone-N` - milestone-specific work
- **Integration Branch**: `[###-feature-name]/integration` - final integration
- Predefined branch structure created during task generation

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation within each milestone
- Milestone order: Foundation → Core features → Advanced features → Polish
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, milestone-organized tasks with branch strategy

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
